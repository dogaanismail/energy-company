# AWS Cost Estimation for Energy Company Microservices
# Generated: August 6, 2025
# **UPDATED FOR TESTING/LEARNING PURPOSES**

## Testing & Learning Deployment Strategy

Since this is for development/testing purposes only and will be torn down after verification, here are cost-effective approaches:

---

## **OPTION 1: Ultra-Minimal Testing (~$15-30 total for 3-5 days)**

### Temporary Testing Configuration:
- **Single t3.medium EC2 instance** with Docker Compose ($25/month = ~$2.50 for 3 days)
- **Single RDS db.t3.micro** (free tier eligible if available) or use containerized PostgreSQL
- **No Load Balancer** - direct access via EC2 public IP
- **No VPC endpoints** - use public internet
- **Basic monitoring only**

**Estimated cost for 3-5 day test: $15-30 total**

---

## **OPTION 2: Minimal ECS Setup (~$50-80 for a week)**

### Streamlined ECS Configuration:
- **Combine microservices** into 3-4 containers instead of 9
- **Use db.t3.micro RDS** (single instance with multiple databases)
- **Single ALB** for all services
- **Minimal VPC** without endpoints (use NAT Gateway only)
- **Basic ECR repositories**

**Estimated cost for 1 week test: $50-80 total**

---

## **OPTION 3: AWS Free Tier Maximized (~$5-15 for testing)**

If you're eligible for AWS Free Tier (first 12 months):
- **ECS Fargate**: 400,000 GB-seconds per month free
- **RDS**: 750 hours of db.t3.micro free
- **ALB**: 750 hours free
- **ECR**: 500MB storage free
- **VPC**: NAT Gateway charges only (~$1-2/day)

**Estimated cost with free tier: $5-15 total**

---

## **RECOMMENDED: Testing Configuration**

For your one-time verification, I recommend **Option 2** with these settings:

### Consolidated Services (4 containers instead of 9):
1. **Combined Backend** (authentication + customer + consumption services)
2. **API Gateway** 
3. **Eureka Server**
4. **Frontend Client**

### Minimal Infrastructure:
- **ECS Fargate**: 0.25 vCPU, 0.5GB per service
- **Single RDS db.t3.micro**: $12/month (~$3 for 1 week)
- **ALB**: $16/month (~$4 for 1 week)
- **No VPC endpoints**: Use public internet for testing

**Total for 1 week testing: ~$25-40**

---

## **Quick Deployment & Teardown Plan**

### Day 1: Deploy
1. Deploy minimal infrastructure
2. Run database migrations
3. Start all services

### Day 2-3: Test
1. Verify all endpoints work
2. Test frontend connectivity
3. Check service-to-service communication
4. Validate database operations

### Day 4: Teardown
1. Delete CloudFormation stack
2. Delete ECR repositories
3. Verify no charges continue

---

## **Even Cheaper Alternative: Local + Cloud Hybrid**

If you want to test the deployment pipeline without full AWS costs:

### Hybrid Approach (~$5-10 total):
- **Run most services locally** with Docker Compose
- **Deploy only 1-2 services to AWS** to test the pipeline
- **Use AWS RDS** for database testing (most important part)
- **Test CI/CD pipeline** deployment process

This validates your deployment automation while minimizing costs.

## **Cost Comparison Summary**

| Approach | Duration | Estimated Cost | What You Validate |
|----------|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Ultra-Minimal EC2** | 3-5 days | $15-30 | Basic functionality |
| **Minimal ECS** | 1 week | $25-40 | Full ECS deployment |
| **Free Tier ECS** | 1 week | $5-15 | Complete architecture |
| **Hybrid Local+Cloud** | 1 week | $5-10 | CI/CD pipeline only |

## **Recommendation for You**

Since this is just for learning and one-time verification:

1. **Use Minimal ECS Setup** (Option 2) for 3-4 days
2. **Consolidate some microservices** to reduce container count
3. **Skip VPC endpoints** initially (can add later if needed)
4. **Use single RDS instance** with multiple databases
5. **Delete everything immediately** after testing

**Expected total cost: $20-35 for complete testing**

This gives you the full microservices experience with proper ECS deployment at minimal cost!
