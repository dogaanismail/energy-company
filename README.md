# ‚ö° Energy Company Platform üîã

A comprehensive energy management system that connects customers with their energy consumption data and metering points.

## üìä Overview

This platform provides customers with tools to monitor their energy usage, manage metering points, and see energy pricing information. The system consists of multiple microservices for scalability and maintainability.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend

- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot** framework
- **Spring Cloud Netflix** for service discovery
- **PostgreSQL** databases
- **Liquibase** for database migrations
- **JWT** for secure authentication

### Frontend

- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Vite** Modern build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **React Router** for navigation
- **React Hook Form** for form handling
- **Recharts** for data visualization
- **React Context API** for global state management (AuthContext)
- **React Hooks** useState, useEffect, useContext for component state management
- **Axios** Promise-based HTTP client for API requests

  **Testing**
- **Jest**: Testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components
- **jest-dom**: Custom matchers for DOM testing

## üß© Components

### Backend Services

- **api-gateway**: Entry point for all client requests
- **authentication-service**: Handles user authentication and JWT token management
- **common**: Shared library with common utilities
- **consumption-service**: Manages energy consumption data and metering points
- **customer-service**: Handles customer information and user authentication and JWT token management
- **elering-adapter**: Integrates with [Estfeed Elering](https://estfeed.elering.ee/exchange-prices) for energy pricing data
- **eureka-server**: Service discovery for microservices

### Frontend Components

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Java 21 (for development)
- Node.js (for frontend development)

### Running the Application ‚öôÔ∏è

The entire application can be started using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start all backend services, databases, and the frontend application.

Once the application is running:
- Frontend: Access the web application at http://localhost:5173/
- Backend APIs: Available through the API Gateway at http://localhost:4000/
- Eureka Dashboard: Monitor services at http://localhost:8761/

### Demo Accounts üë§

The following demo accounts are available for testing:

| Email | Password |

| bob@example.com | energycompany |


## üíª Development

Each microservice follows a modular structure:
- Service implementation
- Database migration application
- Liquibase changelog scripts
